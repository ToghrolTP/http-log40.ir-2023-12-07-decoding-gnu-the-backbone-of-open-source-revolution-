### GNU Project and Free Software Movement
In the pre-Free Software Movement era and before the establishment of the GNU project, the technology scene appeared entirely different. Concepts like freedom and collective participation in software development were not widely recognized, and principles such as user rights and transparency in open-source code were nonexistent. Software ownership was predominantly in the hands of companies and developers, held exclusively. Users couldnâ€™t easily access software source code or modify programs according to their preferences. The idea of collaborative development of software was non-existent. Developers worked independently and in isolation, lacking the freedom to share their code or ideas openly. Users were limited in their ability to modify or adapt software to their needs, often constrained by the restrictions imposed by software creators.

The concept of user freedom in terms of participation in the development process, modification, and sharing of software did not exist in the world before GNU and the Free Software Movement. These principles, introduced by the GNU project and the free software movement, have had a significant impact on the world of technology to this day. In essence, a world without GNU and the free software movement presents an image of constraints and shortcomings in the field of software and technology development. With the establishment of GNU and the free software movement, this landscape has transformed into a different and liberating outlook.

### Richard Stallman The Founding Father
Richard Stallman, a programmer and free software activist from the United States, is recognized as the founder of the GNU project and the creator of the concept of free software. When Stallman began his research and development efforts to create GNU, he introduced principles such as freedom in use, modification, and distribution of software.

In 1971, Stallman entered MIT, where he engaged with a group of individuals associated with the hacker culture (hackers in the sense of creatively inclined individuals). These individuals were passionate about programming, enjoying tasks they could perform with their computers. The members were actively developing a complete operating system, and Stallman joined the development team, tasked with writing and adding programs to the operating system.
